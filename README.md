# Disaster Tweet Classification Kaggle

Project Goal: The goal of this project is to identify whether a tweet is a disaster tweet or not. In this age many people go to twitter on updates during times of emergency. People observing something in real time can report a disaster through twitter and increase notification. Being able to identify what is a real disaster and what is not can help people get notified of disasters around them. Agencies are looking into monitoring twitter for information on disasters in real time.

Dataset: This dataset contains tweets and are labeled as a disaster tweet or regular tweet. It has 7613 entries and 5 columns. The data is formatted as:

text of a tweet
kewyword from that tweet
location
Target is either 0(not a disaster) or 1(disaster)
